code from project of genetic algorithm
population manager generates a group of assets on a platform then the assts start moving just after their creating
some assets will stay on the platform
others will fall from it
we keep the genes for the ones who stayed alive the most (survived)
we notice that these assets adapted to 2 stategies of survival
1 runing toward the farthest end of the platform
2 crouching and waiting for the time to end
